Diabetes De-escalation Concepts/Future Considerations:

**Documented Lows: Proceed with approaches below**

FASTING AVERAGE or WAKE UP AVERAGE or “DURING THE NIGHT”:

\-Therapy reductions or stoppages preference if patient actively on: (Order is established by priority with first drug class referenced in descending order)

Sulfonylurea: (1.1)

| Drug: | When to lower dose: | When to stop: |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Glipizide:  | 10 mg daily or higher 🡪 Cut total dose in half | Less than 10 mg daily |
| Glyburide: | 10 mg daily or higher 🡪 Cut total dose in half | Less than 10 mg daily |
| Glimepiride: | 4 mg daily or higher 🡪 Cut total dose in half | Less than 4 mg daily |

Basal Insulin: (1.2)

| Dose Lowering: |
| :---- |
| Dose 21 units or higher 🡪 Reduce total daily dose by 20% |
| Dose 10-20 units 🡪 Cut dose in half |
| Dose Less than 10 units 🡪 stop insulin therapy  |

\-If neither of above therapies are actively present: reduce doses and/or stop in following order: (Order is established by priority with first drug class referenced in descending order)

1. Pioglitazone – reduce dose by 15 mg OR stop if dose at 15 mg  
   2. Metformin – Cut Dose in half OR stop if dose at 500 mg  
   3. GLP-1 – Go to next lower dose (e.g. Ozempic 1 mg weekly; decrease 0.5 mg weekly)  
   4. Sitagliptin – Stop Therapy  
   5. Bolus Insulin: Reduce dose by 1 unit per meal  
   6. Empagliflozin – Stop therapy unless CHF or CKD co-morbidity; then cut dose in half

POST-PRANDIAL AVERAGE or BEDTIME AVERAGE or “DURING THE DAY”:

\-Therapy reductions or stoppages preference if patient actively on: (Order is established by priority with first drug class referenced in descending order)

a.Bolus Insulin: (2.1)

| Dose Lowering: |
| :---- |
| Total Daily Dose 15 units or higher 🡪 Reduce total daily dose by 20% |
| Total Daily Dose 6-14 unit or less units 🡪 Cut dose in half |
| Total Daily Dose 5 units or less 🡪 Stop bolus insulin |

b.Pioglitazone: (2.2)

| Drug: | How to lower dose: | When to stop: |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Pioglitazone:  | Decrease dose by 15 mg daily | Current dose 15 mg daily |

c.Sulfonylurea: (2.3) 

| Drug: | When to lower dose: | When to stop: |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Glipizide:  | 10 mg daily or higher 🡪 Cut total dose in half | Less than 10 mg daily |
| Glyburide: | 10 mg daily or higher 🡪 Cut total dose in half | Less than 10 mg daily |
| Glimepiride: | 4 mg daily or higher 🡪 Cut total dose in half | Less than 4 mg daily |

d.GLP-1: (2.4)

| Drug: | How to lower dose: | When to stop: |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Semaglutide | 1 mg or higher weekly dose 🡪 Cut dose in half | 0.5 mg weekly |
| Dulaglutide | Stepdown approach: 4.5 mg 🡪 3 mg 🡪 1.5 mg 🡪 0.75 mg  | 0.75 mg weekly |
| Mounjaro | Stepdown approach. 15 mg 🡪 12.5 mg 🡪 10 mg 🡪 7.5 mg 🡪 5 mg 🡪 2.5 mg  | 2.5 mg weekly |
| Liraglutide | 1.8 mg weekly 🡪 decrease dose by 0.6 mg weekly | 0.6 mg weekly |
| Rybelsus | Step down approach: 14 mg 🡪 7 mg 🡪 3 mg | 3 mg |

Basal Insulin: (2.5)

| Dose Lowering: |
| :---- |
| Dose 21 units or higher 🡪 Reduce total daily dose by 20% |
| Dose 10-20 units 🡪 Cut dose in half |
| Dose Less than 10 units 🡪 stop insulin therapy  |

If none of the above therapies are actively present reduce doses and/or stop in following order: (Order is established by priority with first drug class referenced in descending order)

7. Sitagliptin – Stop Therapy  
   8. Metformin – Cut Dose in half OR stop if dose at 500 mg  
   9. Empagliflozin – Stop therapy unless CHF or CKD co-morbidity; then cut dose in half

**Starting High Potency Drugs – How to manage/recommend other therapies:**

1. Basal Insulin:  
   1. Sulfonylurea: Follow recommendation in table 1.1  
   2. Pioglitazone: Follow recommendation in table 2.2  
   3. DPP-IV: Consider stop due to replaceable efficacy  
   4. No other drugs require proactive adjustments  
        
2. Bolus insulin:  
   1. Sulfonylureas: Stop therapy  
   2. Pioglitazone: Follow Recommendations 2.2  
   3. DPP-IV: Consider stop due to replaceable efficacy  
   4. No other drugs require proactive adjustments  
        
3. GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP:  
   1. DPP-IV: Stop therapy  
   2. Sulfonylureas: Follow recommendations table 1.1  
   3. Pioglitazone: Follow Recommendations 2.2  
   4. Basal Insulin: Follow recommendations from table 1.2
