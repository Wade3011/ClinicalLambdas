# Diabetes De-escalation (trimmed)

*When documented lows: use tables below for dose reduction/stop. For full tables and wording, use Knowledge Base retrieval.*

## Priority order when patient is on therapy

**FASTING / WAKE UP / NIGHT LOWS — reduce in this order:**

**Sulfonylurea (table 1.1):** Cut total dose in half if at or above threshold; stop below threshold.
- Glipizide: lower at ≥10 mg daily; stop <10 mg daily.
- Glyburide: lower at ≥10 mg daily; stop <10 mg daily.
- Glimepiride: lower at ≥4 mg daily; stop <4 mg daily.

**Basal insulin (table 1.2):** ≥21 units → reduce by 20%. 10–20 units → cut in half. <10 units → stop.

**If neither above:** Reduce/stop in order: Pioglitazone (reduce 15 mg or stop at 15 mg) → Metformin (cut in half or stop at 500 mg) → GLP-1 (next lower dose) → Sitagliptin (stop) → Bolus (reduce 1 unit/meal) → Empagliflozin (stop unless CHF/CKD; then half).

**POST-PRANDIAL / BEDTIME / DAY LOWS — reduce in this order:**

**Bolus insulin (table 2.1):** ≥15 units → reduce 20%. 6–14 units → cut in half. ≤5 units → stop.

**Pioglitazone (table 2.2):** Decrease by 15 mg; stop at 15 mg daily.

**Sulfonylurea (table 2.3):** Same as 1.1 (cut in half above threshold; stop below).

**GLP-1 (table 2.4):** Step down to next lower dose; stop at lowest (e.g. Semaglutide 0.5 mg weekly, Dulaglutide 0.75 mg, Mounjaro 2.5 mg, Rybelsus 3 mg).

**Basal (table 2.5):** Same as 1.2.

**If none above:** Sitagliptin stop → Metformin half/stop → Empagliflozin stop unless CHF/CKD then half.

## Starting high-potency drugs — adjust other therapies

**Starting basal insulin:** Sulfonylurea → table 1.1. Pioglitazone → table 2.2. DPP-4 → consider stop (replaceable efficacy).

**Starting bolus insulin:** Sulfonylureas → stop. Pioglitazone → 2.2. DPP-4 → consider stop.

**Starting GLP-1 or GLP-1/GIP:** DPP-4 → stop. Sulfonylureas → table 1.1. Pioglitazone → 2.2. Basal → table 1.2. Bolus → table 2.1.
